## The Odin Project

- This is a project done following the course "The Odin Project".
- Everything is created from scratch by myself. Both design and code are original.

## Modules, webpack and DOM

- The main purpose of this project was to put into practice what I just learnt about modules in javascript and webpack.
- Also keep practicing DOM manipulation and how to use it to create singe page applications.
